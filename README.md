# codesignal-enhanced-cobol-data-mgmt

This repository contains the COBOL programs developed as part of the "Enhanced COBOL Data Management" course on CodeSignal.

## Course Description

The "Enhanced COBOL Data Management" course aims to expand foundational COBOL knowledge with a focus on more sophisticated data structures and arithmetic operations. It delves deeper into the understanding of group items, arithmetic operations, and their practical applications, setting the stage for advanced data handling and computations in COBOL programs.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following COBOL programs, each demonstrating specific concepts covered in the course:

* **AdvComputeDemo.cob:** Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using the `COMPUTE` statement on predefined numerical fields.
* **ComputeDemo02.cob:** Illustrates modifications to existing numerical values and the impact on `COMPUTE` operations.
* **AdvComputeDemo03.cob:** Shows the correct usage of the `COMPUTE` statement with group item fields.
* **BalanceCalculator.cob:** Applies arithmetic operations to calculate and display balances for different customers and an overall balance, utilizing the `OF` clause for clarity.
* **BandInfo.cob:** Introduces the definition and manipulation of alphanumeric group items to store band and singer information.
* **BookGroupDemo.cob:** Focuses on defining and working with a simple group item representing a book with its title and ISBN.
* **ComputeDemo.cob:** A basic example of using the `COMPUTE` statement for a simple balance calculation.
* **ComputeDemo02.cob:** Extends the basic computation to include a withdrawal, showcasing the order of operations.
* **ComputeDemo03.cob:** Highlights the importance of using the `OF` clause when referencing fields within different group items.
* **ComputeDemo04.cob:** Demonstrates a straightforward computation involving account balance, deposit, and a pre-calculated tax.
* **ComputeDemo05.cob:** Involves calculations across different group items to determine net balances and a total balance.
* **ComputeExpenses.cob:** Shows how to use the `COMPUTE` statement to calculate total monthly expenses and the average daily expense.
* **FeeBalanceCalculator.cob:** Calculates a new balance after a deposit and deducting an administrative fee, using a group item for bank information.
* **FinanceCalculator.cob:** Demonstrates calculating a new balance with interest and average daily spendings using the `COMPUTE` statement.
* **GroupCalcDemo.cob:** A simple example of performing addition on fields within a group item and displaying the result.
* **GroupCalcDemo02.cob:** Modifies the previous example to perform subtraction instead of addition within a group item.
* **GroupCalcDemo03.cob:** Corrects the syntax for displaying a field within a group item using the `OF` clause.
* **GroupCalcDemo04.cob:** A basic task to add values within a group item and display the result.
* **GroupCalcDemo05.cob:** A fundamental exercise in defining a group item with initial values and performing an addition operation.
* **GroupItemDemo.cob:** Introduces the concept of group items and how to access individual fields and the entire group.
* **GroupItemDemo01.cob:** Shows how to add a new alphanumeric field with a default value to an existing group item.
* **GroupItemDemo02.cob:** Corrects the way to move values to specific fields within a group item.
* **GroupItemDemoPhone.cob:** Extends a group item to include a phone number field and demonstrates how to move data to it.
* **GroupItemsFixTask.cob:** Corrects an error in referencing a field within a nested group item.
* **MoreGroupItems.cob:** Demonstrates the use of similar field names across different group items and how the `OF` clause distinguishes them.
* **MoreGroupItems02.cob:** A task to assign specific values to similarly named fields in different group items.
* **MoreGroupItems03.cob:** Focuses on displaying the values of identically named fields from different group items.
* **SalaryCalc.cob:** A straightforward program to calculate a new salary by adding a bonus to the current salary, using a group item.
* **SuperheroProfile.cob:** Extends a group item to include more attributes of a superhero, such as codename and alliances.

## Learning Objectives

Through the programs in this repository, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

* Defining and utilizing **group items** to structure related data.
* Performing various **arithmetic operations** using the `COMPUTE`, `ADD`, and `SUBTRACT` statements.
* Understanding the importance and usage of the **`OF` clause** for unambiguous data referencing within group items.
* Working with different **data types** including alphanumeric (`PIC X`) and numeric (`PIC 9`, `PIC S9V99`).
* Initializing **default values** for data fields.
* Displaying the contents of individual fields and entire group items.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a record of my progress in the "Enhanced COBOL Data Management" course. The included programs demonstrate the fundamental concepts of advanced data structures and arithmetic operations in COBOL, providing a solid foundation for more complex programming tasks in the future.
